Introduction
This R Markdown document performs data cleaning and exploratory analysis on the TB dataset using Python. It includes loading the dataset, basic exploration, visualization, and data preprocessing.

Load Dataset and Basic Exploration
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
tb = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jobmrtall/MSD/refs/heads/main/TB.csv')

# Display basic dataset information
print(tb.shape)  # Print dataset dimensions (rows, columns)
print(tb.isna().sum())  # Count missing values in each column
tb.info()  # Summary of dataset structure

# Display the frequency of country occurrences and regional distribution
print(tb.value_counts('Country or territory name'))
print(tb['Region'].value_counts())
```

Data Visualization
This section generates boxplots and line plots to understand population distribution and TB prevalence trends.
```{python}
# Boxplot of population distribution by region
sns.boxplot(x='Region', y='Estimated total population number', data=tb)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)  # Rotate x-axis labels for readability
plt.show()


```

Data Cleaning and Imputation
This section removes columns with excessive missing data, imputes categorical and numerical missing values, and converts the Year column into the appropriate format.
```{python}
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
# Drop columns with more than 50% missing values
tb.dropna(axis=1, thresh=len(tb) * 0.5, inplace=True)

# Drop rows with less than 5% missing values
to_drop = tb.columns[tb.isna().sum() <= len(tb) * 0.05]
tb = tb.dropna(subset=to_drop)

# Convert Year to datetime format
tb['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(tb['Year'], format='%Y').dt.year
```

Imputation of Missing Value
Categorical missing values are filled using mode, and numerical missing values are imputed using the median.
```{python}
# Separate categorical and numerical columns
cat_cols = tb.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
num_cols = tb.select_dtypes(include=['float64']).columns

# Impute categorical columns using mode
t = tb[['Year', 'Country or territory name', 'ISO 2-character country/territory code',
        'ISO 3-character country/territory code', 'Region',
        'Method to derive prevalence estimates', 'Method to derive mortality estimates',
        'Method to derive incidence estimates']]
t = t.fillna('unknown')
mode_df = t.groupby(['Region', 'Year'])['Method to derive incidence estimates'].agg(pd.Series.mode).reset_index()

# Convert mode values to a dictionary
mode_dict = mode_df.set_index(['Region', 'Year'])['Method to derive incidence estimates'].to_dict()

def impute_mode(row):
    if pd.isna(row['Method to derive incidence estimates']):
        return mode_dict.get((row['Region'], row['Year']), row['Method to derive incidence estimates'])
    return row['Method to derive incidence estimates']

# Apply mode imputation
tb['Method to derive incidence estimates'] = tb.apply(impute_mode, axis=1)

# Function to impute numerical columns using median
def impute_median(df, col):
    median_dict = df.groupby(['Region', 'Year'])[col].median().to_dict()
    df[col] = df.apply(lambda row: median_dict.get((row['Region'], row['Year']), row[col]) if pd.isna(row[col]) else row[col], axis=1)

# Apply median imputation for numerical columns
for col in num_cols:
    impute_median(tb, col)
tb.head()
```

acessing the cleaned imputed data, then renaming the name of columns to more clear short and precise name 
```{python}
tb=pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jobmrtall/MSD/refs/heads/main/tb_cleand.csv')

# Apply renaming
tb.rename(columns=rename_dict, inplace=True)
```

Description: visualizing the distribution of each column with float data type to examine the outliers

```{python}
tf = tb.select_dtypes(include=['float64']).columns

# Reshape data to long format for FacetGrid
tb_melted = tb.melt(value_vars=tf, var_name='Feature', value_name='Value')

# Create the FacetGrid
g = sns.FacetGrid(tb_melted, col='Feature', col_wrap=3, sharex=False, sharey=False)
g.map(sns.boxplot, 'Value')

# Adjust layout
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

Description: by calculating the interquantile range we obtained the lower and upper bound. Then we kept replacing values that goes surppaising the bounds in either ways by the value of upper and lower bounds accordingly.this is done to prevent creation of na values which could have happen if we were to remove the outliers for every specfic feature. As a row having an outlier in some feature would have a value within the interquartile range in another.
Sp we used the clip method
```{python}
# Compute IQR-based lower and upper bounds
Q1 = tb[tf].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = tb[tf].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Clip values to IQR range
tb[tf] = tb[tf].clip(lower=lower_bound, upper=upper_bound, axis=1)


tb.isna().sum()
```

visualizing the data after managing the outliers

```{python}
tf = tb.select_dtypes(include=['float64']).columns

# Reshape data to long format for FacetGrid
tb_melted = tb.melt(value_vars=tf, var_name='Feature', value_name='Value')

# Create the FacetGrid
g = sns.FacetGrid(tb_melted, col='Feature', col_wrap=3, sharex=False, sharey=False)
g.map(sns.boxplot, 'Value')

# Adjust layout
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS OF TB DATA SET
The descriptive statistics were done for specfic grouos of the data set which were grouped by means of
1 region
2 countries
3 year
4 year and region

```{python}
tb_r=tb.groupby(['Region']).describe(include=[float])
print(tb_r.head())
tb_c=tb.groupby('Country').describe(include=[float])
print(tb_c.head())
tb_y=tb.groupby('Year').describe(include=['float'])
print(tb_y.head())
tb_r_y=tb.groupby(['Year','Region']).describe(include=[float])
print(tb_r_y.head())

```

CORRELATION
To do the correlation we filterd a data set containg only the cloumns with the numeric values.
Additionally we dropped the columns of lower and upper bounds of the a specfic attribute using only the center or actual value for correlating.



```{python}
tb_num=tb.select_dtypes(['int64','float64'])
tb_num_fltr=tb_num[['ISONum', 'Year', 'Pop', 'TB_Prev_100k', 'TB_Prev', 'TB_Mort_100k',
    'TB_Deaths', 'TB_HIV_Mort_100k', 'TB_HIV_Deaths', 'TB_Inc_100k',
    'TB_Cases', 'TB_HIV_Perc', 'TB_HIV_Inc_100k', 'TB_HIV_Cases', 'Case_Detect']]
corr=tb_num_fltr.corr()
corr
```

visualizing the correlation by means of heatmap
```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(30, 30))  # Set figure size
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5)  # Heatmap
plt.title("Correlation Matrix")  # Add title
plt.show()
```
 sorting the correlation values pulling out rank of correlaation only on there magnitude no sign used in this section
 
```{python}
corr = tb_num_fltr.corr()

# Convert correlation matrix to a long format (stacked form)
corr_pairs = corr.unstack()

# Remove self-correlations (correlation of a variable with itself is always 1)
corr_pairs = corr_pairs[corr_pairs < 1].drop_duplicates()

# Sort correlations from highest to lowest
sorted_corr_mag = corr_pairs.abs().sort_values(ascending=False)

sorted_corr_mag
```
 based on the there signs now its ranked 
```{python}
sorted_corr_sign = corr_pairs.sort_values(ascending=False)
sorted_corr_sign
```
 filtering out those with high correlation
 as high was defined for those scoring above 0.8
```{python}
high_corr=sorted_corr_sign[sorted_corr_sign>0.8]
high_corr
```
DESCRIPTION ON HIGHLY CORRELATED FEATURES
 The following correlations indicate strong positive relationships between tuberculosis-related variables.

1. TB Prevalence vs. TB Cases (0.98)

Meaning: Nearly a perfect correlation. The total number of TB cases strongly determines the overall prevalence.

Implication: TB control efforts must focus on reducing new cases to bring down prevalence.


2. TB Prevalence per 100k vs. TB Incidence per 100k (0.96)

Meaning: Countries with a high TB burden also experience high rates of new infections.

Implication: To reduce TB prevalence, new infections must be prevented through better screening and treatment.


3. TB Prevalence vs. TB Deaths (0.95)

Meaning: More TB cases lead to higher mortality.

Implication: Countries with high TB prevalence need better healthcare infrastructure to lower TB-related deaths.


4. TB-HIV Deaths vs. TB-HIV Cases (0.95)

Meaning: The number of HIV-positive TB cases strongly predicts the number of deaths.

Implication: HIV patients with TB need early treatment to prevent mortality.


5. TB-HIV Mortality per 100k vs. TB-HIV Incidence per 100k (0.93)

Meaning: High TB-HIV incidence rates lead to more TB-HIV deaths.

Implication: Integrated TB and HIV treatment is crucial to reducing fatalities.


6. TB Deaths vs. TB Cases (0.93)

Meaning: Higher TB case numbers are linked to more deaths.

Implication: Early detection and treatment programs can significantly reduce TB mortality.


7. TB Prevalence per 100k vs. TB Mortality per 100k (0.91)

Meaning: Countries with high TB prevalence also have high mortality rates.

Implication: This correlation highlights the need for stronger TB treatment and prevention strategies.


8. TB Mortality per 100k vs. TB Incidence per 100k (0.87)

Meaning: Countries with high TB incidence often have high mortality rates.

Implication: This suggests a need for better case management and access to treatment.


9. TB-HIV Mortality per 100k vs. TB-HIV Deaths (0.84)

Meaning: More TB-HIV deaths increase the overall TB-HIV mortality rate.

Implication: Strengthening TB-HIV co-treatment programs is critical.


10. TB-HIV Percentage vs. TB-HIV Incidence per 100k (0.83)

Meaning: Higher HIV-TB incidence leads to a higher percentage of TB cases being HIV-positive.

Implication: Countries with high TB-HIV burden should prioritize ART (antiretroviral therapy) and TB prevention.


11. TB-HIV Incidence per 100k vs. TB-HIV Cases (0.82)

Meaning: More HIV-positive TB cases indicate a higher incidence rate.

Implication: This supports the need for improved HIV testing among TB patients.

Key Takeaways

TB Prevalence is closely tied to new cases, deaths, and mortality.

HIV-associated TB significantly increases TB mortality rates.

Reducing TB incidence is critical for lowering overall TB burden and deaths.

Integrated TB-HIV programs are necessary to address co-infection risks.
